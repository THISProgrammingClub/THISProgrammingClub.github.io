    <p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">Together, when referring back to the prosperity we achieved for the past years that allows us to stand here today as citizens of the most powerful nation on Earth, we must never forget that it was because our founding fathers have fought for individual liberty and dignity to a greater extent that has ever been done. And this battle saturated with the spirit of independence and human rights has proven to be the most successful in human history. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">Recently, you and I are presented with rising concerns regarding the student debt crisis, gun violence and illegal immigration. It couldn&rsquo;t be more evident that those problems arose due to the excessive governmental intervention in our everyday lives. This is an issue that we must solve right here right now. Our government is by the people and for the people. You and I must not abandon our founding values and the revolution our fathers have fought. We will not let the government rule over us. Together with the government, we shall acknowledge and make changes to these issues we&rsquo;re facing. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">On Education, our nation nurtures individuals that possess equal opportunity more than anything. Thus, is it undeniable that our education system should model this longstanding ideal? As </span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">the Party of opportunity&rdquo;, we believe several alterations must be made to our education system in response to the ongoing student debt crisis. Founded on the very ideal of freedom, we must limit government&rsquo;s interventions in education to maximize the system&rsquo;s capabilities to provide the highest education to those whose achievements deserve it. Student loans shouldn&rsquo;t be offered by the government. Rather, the government will serve only as an insurance guarantor for private sector loans. By doing so, equality and freedom could be ensured in our market, as individuals interact without being manipulated by the government. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">In the status quo, federal government has monopolized the student loan system after it was nationalized by Obamacare, completely ignoring students&rsquo; ability to pay back when offering those loans. The class of 2015 was the most indebted class in history, </span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">with the average debt per graduate being slightly&nbsp;over $35,000.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">[1] </span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">More frightening, college debt in American had exceeded the amount of credit card debt by $521 billion [2]. The student debt crisis we are now facing today is reaching more than $1.5 trillion, causing massive disparity in schooling</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;"> opportunit</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">ies among our students. Guess what, federal loans are exacerbating this problem, </span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">every $3 increase in such loans, colleges and universities raise tuition by $2&rdquo; </span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">[3].</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">&nbsp;They </span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">are </span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">directly giving rise to the cost for children to receive education. As they increase the chance for people to get college credentials, causing workers&rsquo; displacement in the labor market would leave individuals without a credential vulnerable when competing for jobs that were previously available for them. While we think people are pursing great opportunities, it had created more inequality for our people.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">As a result, we must cut federal loan as it allows the government to monopolize the system and render uneven income distribution. Only through this mean can the freedom and equality our fathers have fought for be preserved.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">Moving on to gun c</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">ontro</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">l. As firearms continue to increase in power, questions on gun control inevitably arise. It is obvious that arms have developed more than just a bit since the founding of our country. Our country&mdash;the role model of democracy&mdash;has degraded into the home of gun violence, with 340 mass shootings happening last year. We have to solve gun violence directly without shielding our responsibilities to take action behind </span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">shock and disbelief.&rdquo; Gun violence has been existing right before our eyes for way too long.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">I oppose the blind adherence to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment. Laws, no matter how much praise it receives, may be outdated. Take the </span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">&ldquo;</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">twenty dollars&rdquo; in the 7<sup>th</sup> Amendment for example, do we still go to court with a full team of juries for $20 in these days? In the Las Vegas shooting in 2017, one man was able to kill 59 unaware citizens and injure 422 more. To our founding fathers, this level of power might be un-imaginable as they drafted our constitution.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">I also oppose the direct disregard of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment. It is simply impossible to uphold any other amendment under an armed bureaucracy and a brutal police system. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment shouldn&rsquo;t be strictly adhered to, but its values are crucial to our democracy.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">Therefore, to maintain balance between the people and the state, and to prevent the abuse of firepower within the people, I propose:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt; margin: 0cm 16.7pt .0001pt 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;"> Stric</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">ter background checking for gun sales:</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 0cm 16.7pt .0001pt 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">There is no doubt whether we should stop giving guns to people who are not responsible enough to use them. We are dealing with the ability to kill and injure hundreds, and it is simply absurd to promote mass shootings for profit.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 16.7pt .0001pt 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">But we all know that one license cannot apply forever. A person may turn mentally ill years after getting licensed, and there is nothing mysterious about it. Communities should be enabled to lock up people&rsquo;s arms when their licenses do not apply, until they can pass the background test again.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt; margin: 0cm 16.7pt .0001pt 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;"> Encourage setting up security measures:</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 0cm 16.7pt .0001pt 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">Although the state shouldn&rsquo;t interfere with the right to bear arms, civilians and private organizations should. The government should aid local organizations to install weapon detectors by funding it.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt; margin: 0cm 16.7pt .0001pt 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;"> Ban undetectable weapons:</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 0cm 16.7pt .0001pt 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">As public assemblies should be registered, guns should also be exposed. Hiding guns do not keep anyone safe, physically or emotionally. If we encourage detectors, we must also ban sneaky ways to get around them. This includes anything that gets away with basic security measures, such as plastic guns and 3-D printed guns.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt; margin: 0cm 16.7pt .0001pt 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;"> Limit the total amount of fire power per person:</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 0cm 16.7pt .0001pt 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">I believe fighting an armed bureaucracy needs lots of united citizens, not lots of guns per citizen. There is simply no way to justify having multiple semi-automatic weapons or even having automatic ones. Each person should only be allowed 2 semi-automatic weapons maximum, and automatic weapons should be banned. State governments should be allowed to lower that number, but not allowed to raise it.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 16.7pt .0001pt 18.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">Now to the subject of i</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">mmigration</span><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">. The American government, like any government of any country, has the obligation to prioritize the interests of its existing citizens. To this end, we must secure our borders, as it is the basis for our national sovereignty. Foreign immigrants traveling here have undoubtedly enriched our country, but requiring them to do so legally is vital to the safety and economic wellbeing of Americans. We want an immigration system that allows new immigrants experience the American Dream without causing hardships to our citizens. And as citizens, you and I must call for the enforcement of border security to both uphold our sovereignty and protect our prosperity.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">First and foremost, our borders must be absolutely secured and we must curb illegal immigration. It is the right of every nation to get to decide who to let in to their borders and who not to. Reform of the immigration process to accommodate for the current refugee influx is possible, but only if illegal immigration is drastically reduced. This means that we must increase the use of reconnaissance cameras, border patrol agents, and unmanned aerial flights and other new technologies at borders.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">For illegal aliens themselves, for those who help smuggle illegal aliens into the country, and for those who create fraudulent documents to prolong the ability of illegal aliens to stay in the country, we shall enact penalties. Deportation should be an option used by our border security agencies. Providing amnesty to illegal immigrants will only further encourage illegal immigration. Immigrants who enter this country illegally shouldn&rsquo;t be provided with the same benefits that legal immigrants or citizens possess.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">Throughout our history, legal immigration has greatly contributed to the growth and prosperity of our nation, and it&rsquo;s no different today. To ensure this trend continues, our immigration system should emphasize the skills that our economy needs most, as well as prioritizing the family of hard working immigrants legally in the country. There couldn&rsquo;t be a better way right now to attract specialized skilled workers than to increase the number of H-1B visas.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">As the republican candidate, I believe that you and I are strong independent individuals who can work with the government to address the problems we face. I urge every single one of you to unleash your individual genius and generate the best solutions for all of us.</span></p>
