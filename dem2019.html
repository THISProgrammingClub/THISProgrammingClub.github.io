We the Democratic Party, in order to establish a more perfect democracy, to secure justice, insure domestic unity, and provide for common defense, do ordain and establish this Manifesto for the United States of America. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 19.0pt; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 252.0pt 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">In the 240 years since this nation has been recognized, we have journeyed on a great path to prosperity. Under the leadership of our esteemed Democratic presidents, we have come through thick and thin, braced ourselves against internal and external storms, and persevered still. With the leadership of President Barack Obama, and through the hard work of the American people, we hurdled over the Great Recession. The private-sector growth in </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">America</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">n businesses have now added over 15</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;"> million</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;"> jobs since 2010</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">. Twenty million people have gained health insurance coverage</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;"> as a result of Obama-care. And the American auto industry, rich with history, is booming more than ever. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 19.0pt; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 252.0pt 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">However, despite how far we&rsquo;ve come, too many Americans have been left behind. Issues of wage gap, racial divide, inequality, and the rigidity of the social structure have all continued to worsen as the cost of everything from small commodities to college education continues to rise. </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">As </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">honest citizens struggle</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">, the top </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">1% </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">accrues more wealth and more power. Our well-meaning Republican friends in Congress have chosen </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">to go against the Constitutional values of equality, and idly watch as dysfunction and corruption spread over the </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">solutions </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">for the</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;"> challenges we face. </span></p>

In the present age, education is the basis of such equality of opportunity. Higher education should without doubt be encouraged, not defamed as a thieving scam, to be considered as analogously infamous as the debt it inevitably brings. Every American should be able to reach for their dreams and pertain their happiness through higher education, but the question of student loans plays an integral part in that decision. The Democratic Party&rsquo;s stance on student loans is that they should still be offered by the federal government. The problem that causes the student debt crisis is not the existence of a federal loan itself, rather, it is the public&rsquo;s understanding of student loans that must be revised and improved. As long the public is made well aware of risks and precautions of student loans as well as loaning itself with full transparency, we can be sure that the benefits of higher education and student loans come with minimal risks. To ensure that every student loan is taken seriously, as well as in maintaining the opportunity for every individual to be able to reach for their dreams, funding for public education should only be raised, not cut down.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 19.0pt; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 252.0pt 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>

With this funding withdrawn from public schools, a vast majority of the funding was used to fund private and religious schools ($400 million), with only 1 billion given to public schools to expand, and the remainder of the 10.6 billion sum used as retribution for government activities after several tax cuts on the rich. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 19.0pt; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 252.0pt 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">This plan may be detrimental to future expansion and progress to be made in public schools, the essential institutions where the mass majority of the American populous relies on for education (50.7 million students out of a total of 56.6 million in 2018). </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 19.0pt; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 252.0pt 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 19.0pt; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 252.0pt 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">The next step would be to sustain federal loans. Since private loans cost much more and have much less favorable terms compared to federal loans, (and are generally only used when students have exhausted the borrowing limit under federal student loans), it can only be reasonable that the federal government can step in and alleviate the debt situation. Private loans are not eligible for Income Based Repayment plans, and frequently have less flexible payment terms, higher fees, and more penalties &ndash; all in essence a part of the &ldquo;hidden fees&rdquo; that private banks have devised as profiteering strategies over the years, targeting those most vulnerable in the working class. Thus, federal loans are the only way to guarantee that students are given fair and equal starting grounds in higher education.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 19.0pt; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 252.0pt 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>

The plan itself will not increase the amount of funds available for student loans ready for distribution, but rather to increase public understanding of the benefits and risks of taking student loans: allowing individuals to understand which types of loans are most suitable, and how to make a sustainable plan for the future after education. We</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;"> will </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">also look to </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">allow those who currently have student debt to refinance their loans at the lowest rates possible. We will simplify and expand access to income-based repayment so that no student loan borrowers ever have to pay more than they can afford.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 19.0pt; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 252.0pt 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">&nbsp;Other organizations, such as the Student Loan Assistance foundation, </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">the Public Service Loan Forgiveness, loan discharge programs begun by the Obama Administration and </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">other non-governmental organizations which provide assistance in the relevant area, will receive government backing.</span></p>

We will ensure that our children have health care, stable housing free of contaminants, and communities free of violence. </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">These will be among other concrete steps in reducing the curriculum gap in the schools across America in more standardized education through incentivized government programs. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 19.0pt; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 252.0pt 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>

We, as a country founded upon innovators and pioneers, must continue to ensure that money cannot be an automatic backdoor into higher education, and that the quality of such selection is standardized and fair for all. Cheating the system cannot be brushed aside, and while we respect the privacy of private institutions, we must not let them abuse this privacy for the benefit of the elite.</span></p>

That is why we will strengthen the gainful employment rule to ensure that for-profit schools enable students to complete their degrees and prepare them for work. We will go after for-profits that engage in deceptive marketing, fraud, and other illegal practices. We will also exercise our responsibility in oversight over the Department of Education to carry out their obligation to close down those for-profit schools that consistently engage in fraudulent and illegal conduct. It is unacceptable that for-profit schools with low graduation rates keep encouraging their students to take out federal loans they will have trouble paying back. Therefore, to the maximum extent possible, we will also encourage widespread relief and the forgiveness of debt to those students harmed by the practices of fraudulent institutions.</span></p>

Gun violence is an evil that no man, woman, or child should ever have to face, yet it is an evil that has already touched the lives of millions of Americans, directly or indirectly. We, as the Democratic Party, feels the need to clarify that our stance on gun control is not to confiscate and regulate all firearms available to citizens, but to simply increase regulations upon the right to own a firearm to avoid gun violence. Keeping communities safe and respecting the rights of gun owners are not mutually exclusive. In order to limit the possibilities of gun violence we believe that the right to own a firearm is subject to reasonable regulation. And to that we believe an honest, open national conversation of firearms and its future in America. </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">The Democratic Party believes that we must take immediate action to address gun violence, to save American lives. </span></p>

As the laws regarding gun violence in the United States is only as strong as that of its most loosely regulated state. However, this federal intervention will only establish bare minimums in gun ownership, should individual states feel the need to heighten their security, that is still up to the individual state. </span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">Immigration System</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">America was founded by immigrants of different ethnicities, cultures, and languages; its development was fueled by the influx of immigrant laborers, from the Westward Expansion to the Industrial Revolution. Our national identity can only be strengthened with immigration. However, more than 11 million immigrants without legal documents are within our borders, a precarious situation which tears families apart and prevent undocumented workers from ever being anything else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">The participants in the DACA program repealed by Trump in 2017 facing the coming threat of deportation in 2020 is our priority to address. As numerous studies have shown, among many programs, DACA is one that is beneficial for not only the participants but also the overall American economy and society. Statistically, these immigrants already living in the United States, who are assets to their communities and contribute so much to our country, should be incorporated completely into our society through legal processes. They help to bridge the American recognition of immigrants with the reality that these immigrants have already made home in the US and therefore would be impractical and unnecessary to be deported from the US. To prioritize the mutual good for both the immigrants and the American, we demand the reactivation of DACA and the enforcement of its effects by collaborating with United We Dream and the ACLU, making sure that the participants could make the best out of their new rights (social security number etc.) in education and employment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">While we advocate for open-border policies in terms of DACA and TPS reactivation and visa promotion, we must address the potential threat of terrorism by turning our targets from ethnic groups to individuals. For the former is only contributive in rendering the US with the image of a conservative, racist image. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">Firstly, we should encourage information sharing with other countries to mark individuals who are suspected in not just our borders. Terrorism is no longer an issue faced by isolated nations, but by the international community. To combat international terrorism, one must harness international efforts. The Democratic Party will look to implement TTIC system (Terrorist Tracking and International Communication) that will allow all nations to take part in further security in their borders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">This system will encourage the sharing of information to mark individuals who are suspected in more than one country. Other government initialized programs such as the NAILS (National Automated Immigration Lookout System) database will also be on track to expand by becoming incorporated as a sister institution of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">Next, we should expand the NAILS (National Automated Immigration Lookout System) by incorporating information from FBI&nbsp;to build a more comprehensive database for tracking down terrorists.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">As the current administration is posing a variety of challenges on employment and investment-based visa applicants, we demand to lift those challenges and lower the bar. We must recognize the significance working immigrants have on our economy and society. Not only is our innovation economy driven by the breakthroughs and labor supply made possible by the employment-based immigrants, a great portion of the funding for our private businesses and government projects are contributed by the investment-based immigrants. </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif;">Instead of making the process unnecessarily complex, we should promote easier application processes for H-1B, EB, and L visas. </span></p>
